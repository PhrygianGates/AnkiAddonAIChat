Here's a project structure that you can use to develop an Anki add-on that enables chatting with an AI around each card word. I'll break down what each file's purpose should be to give you a clear understanding of how they all fit together.

### File Breakdown

#### 1. `__init__.py`
This is a Python package initializer. Since you have multiple folders, adding an `__init__.py` file helps define each folder as a Python package. This makes it easier to import functionalities across the project.

#### 2. `manifest.json`
This file describes the add-on's metadata, such as name, version, author, and other details that Anki uses to manage your add-on. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "AI Chat with Card",
  "version": "1.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "Chat with an AI around the card's word.",
  "target_version": "2.1.0"
}
```

#### 3. `main.py`
This is the core entry point for your add-on. It typically contains hooks that connect your code to Anki's existing events and logic.
- Adds a button or shortcut to each Anki card to start a chat session.
- Links GUI and API functionalities.
- Hooks into the appropriate Anki signal to add the button when cards are reviewed.

#### 4. `gui/chat_window.py`
Contains the GUI code for the chat window.
- Utilizes PyQt (Anki's GUI toolkit) to design the chat window that pops up when a user wants to chat about a word.
- Handles interactions between the user and the AI (e.g., text input, displaying AI responses).

#### 5. `gui/__init__.py`
An initializer to mark the `gui/` folder as a Python package, enabling easy imports of GUI components.

#### 6. `api/ai_interface.py`
This is where the interaction with the AI model takes place.
- Can include the logic to call an API, e.g., OpenAI API or a local AI model.
- Manages the API key and request/response handling.

#### 7. `api/__init__.py`
An initializer to mark the `api/` folder as a Python package, enabling easy imports of API components.

#### 8. `resources/styles.css`
Contains CSS styles for customizing the look of your GUI.
- Useful for keeping the GUI neat and matching it to the Anki theme.

#### 9. `resources/icons/chat_icon.png`
Contains icons or other image assets.
- This chat icon can be used in the GUI to indicate the chat feature in the Anki card review interface.

#### 10. `utils/helpers.py`
Contains helper functions that are reused throughout the project.
- Utility functions like text preprocessing, cleaning AI responses, handling exceptions, etc.
- Keeps code organized and avoids repeating code.

#### 11. `utils/__init__.py`
An initializer to mark the `utils/` folder as a Python package, enabling easy imports of utility components.

#### 12. `config.py`
Holds user-configurable settings, such as API keys, parameters for the AI model, and other settings that a user might want to modify.
- You could allow users to specify the model type or temperature settings.

#### 13. `language_settings.py`
This file will handle the language settings for the add-on.
- Allows users to select the language (English or French) for interacting with the AI.
- Provides methods to get the appropriate prompts and responses based on the selected language.

#### 14. `README.md`
Documentation for the add-on.
- Instructions on how to install, set up, and use the add-on.
- Provides any troubleshooting information for users.

### Brief Overview of How It Works:
- **Button Added**: `main.py` adds a button to the card reviewer interface using Anki hooks.
- **Chat UI**: When a user clicks the button, `gui/chat_window.py` creates a chat window.
- **AI Interaction**: The chat window uses `api/ai_interface.py` to send the user’s input to the AI model and fetch responses.
- **Helpers**: `utils/helpers.py` helps with preprocessing text, error handling, or any other required utility tasks.

This modular approach helps keep the project organized, makes it easy to maintain, and facilitates testing individual components. Let me know if you need more details about any specific file or its implementation!
